# Swingy
The goal of this project is implementation of a minimalistic text-based RPG game with the SWING framework that follows the Model-View-Controller architecture and allows switching between the console view and GUI view. A player can have multiple heroes of different types. After choosing a hero the actual game begins. The initial position of the hero is in the center of the map. He wins the game if he reaches on of the borders of the map.
